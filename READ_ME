This code is a sample Convex Mesh Cutting system designed for Workplace Hazard (https://alexmartin4.itch.io/workplace-hazard)
This project is dependent upon Ezy-Slice Convex Mesh Cutting which is accessible here (https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice)
Please note that this code works as part of a larger whole and therefore might include dangling refferences.

Thanks for chceking it out :)
